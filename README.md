# About LicenseHub project

The LicenseHub is a software solution designed to centralize the management of software licenses and license tracking
while also providing simple customer management functionalities.

The intended users of the system are small business owners and entrepreneurs who have limited resources
and seek a solution to provide both licenses and customer management.

In the future, the software will interface with external systems, primarily the clients' software applications using the server.
These interfaces enable license verification, software updates, user notifications, and general data synchronization.

Currently in the phase of implementation.
